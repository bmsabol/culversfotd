This is a simple script I wrote for fun after I finished reading "Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches" by Don Jones and Jeff Hicks (Link: https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Windows-PowerShell-Month-Lunches/dp/1617294160/)

I also did a little googling to fill in a couple gaps to make this work.

This script will reach out to Culvers website and pull down today's flavor of the day for the restaurant that you specify. You will need to input the restaurant section of the URL for your local restaurant you wish to check. Ex: If the URL for your restaurant is https://www.culvers.com/restaurants/franklin-park then you need to input the 'franklin-park' section as the restaurantURL parameter.

This script isn't that great yet - my error handling doesn't really work at the moment but as my skills improve i'll try to come back and improve on it. Until then, enjoy!
